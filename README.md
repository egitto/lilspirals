# How to use:
Install `numpy` and `transforms3d` (using `pip` or `easyinstall` or whatever it is kids do these days)
Run `python spiral.py`

# Tips
If you don't want to install `transforms3d` then you can remove the lines about quaternions and it should mostly work, but it won't rotate
Fiddle with the params in `animate` to change the animation or number of points
Fiddle with the global `theta` for funzies
Fiddling with the overallShape class, specifically `r_of` and `z_of` to make different shapes
If you figure out how `get_dt` is supposed to work, please let me know!
